## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our app is a bug tracker that companies will use to allow their users to report bugs/issues with the company software. Once the user has submitted a bug, admin users will be able to use the app to assign the ticket to any admin user to work on, and update the status as the ticket moves from new to in progress to completed. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. 
Create ticket: Users will be able to create a new ticket when logged in. 
View user tickets: Users will be able to view all tickets they have created and the current status. 
Assign tickets: Admin users will be able to assign a ticket to an admin user to work on.
Update ticket status: Admin users will be able to update the status of a ticket. Updating the status will cause the ticket cad to move to the correct column on the kanban board
Add ticket comments: Users will be able to add comments to a ticket
### Technologies
C#
.NET
ASP.NET
MySQL
Razor templates
### What I'll Have to Learn
We want the admin users’ view of all the tickets to be a kanban board, where they can drag and drop each ticket into the appropriate column depending on status. In order to implement this we’ll need to learn: SignalR, jQuery, and more.
